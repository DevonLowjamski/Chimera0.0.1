# Performance Benchmark Results

This directory contains automated performance benchmark results for Project Chimera.

## File Structure

- `BenchmarkResults_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Individual benchmark run results
- `PerformanceBaseline.json` - Performance baseline data for regression detection
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Benchmark Result Format

Each benchmark result file contains:
- Timestamp and system information
- Individual scenario results (FPS, frame time, memory usage)
- Performance snapshots over time
- Pass/fail status against targets
- Summary statistics

## Performance Baseline

The baseline file establishes expected performance metrics for regression detection:
- Baseline FPS for clean system
- Baseline frame time
- Baseline memory usage
- System configuration information

## Usage

Results are automatically generated when running:
- PC016-1b automated performance benchmarks
- Manual benchmark triggers via AutomatedBenchmarkScheduler
- Scheduled benchmark runs

## CI Integration

These results can be integrated with continuous integration systems for:
- Automated performance regression detection
- Build failure on critical performance drops
- Performance trend analysis over time
