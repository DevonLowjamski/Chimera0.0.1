2. **IPMSystemBase.cs** - Foundation system architecture  
3. **IPMBattleSystemBase.cs** - Base battle system framework

### Manager Implementations  
4. **IPMBiologicalManager.cs** - Biological control system management
5. **IPMPestManager.cs** - Pest detection and tracking
6. **IPMEnvironmentalManager.cs** - Environmental factor management
7. **IPMStrategyManager.cs** - Strategic planning and decision making
8. **IPMAnalyticsManager.cs** - Performance analytics and reporting
9. **IPMGamingManager.cs** - Gaming mechanics and player engagement
10. **IPMManagerImplementations.cs** - Concrete manager implementations

### Data Structure Files
11. **IPMPestDataStructures.cs** - Pest-related data definitions
12. **IPMBiologicalDataStructures.cs** - Biological control data structures
13. **IPMStrategyDataStructures.cs** - Strategic planning data types
14. **IPMAnalyticsDataStructures.cs** - Analytics and metrics data structures

### Supporting Systems
15. **IPMSupportingSystems.cs** - Auxiliary system components
16. **IPMStubs.cs** - Stub implementations and interfaces

## Current Clean Implementation

### Working Foundation
- **CleanIPMManager.cs** - Minimal viable IPM system with basic functionality
- **IPMSharedTypes.cs** - Clean data types without circular dependencies
- **IPMSystemInitializer.cs** - System initialization (fixed and working)

### Core Features Preserved
- ✅ Pest detection and tracking
- ✅ Treatment application system
- ✅ Battle result tracking
- ✅ Basic analytics and success rate calculation
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Threat level assessment

## Rebuild Strategy - 4 Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Systems (Weeks 1-2)
**Priority: Critical**
```
1. IPMEntityManagerBase.cs → Rebuild as CleanIPMEntityManagerBase
2. IPMSystemBase.cs → Rebuild as CleanIPMSystemBase  
3. IPMBattleSystemBase.cs → Rebuild as CleanIPMBattleSystemBase
4. IPMSupportingSystems.cs → Rebuild as CleanIPMSupportingSystems
```

**Goals:**
- Establish clean inheritance hierarchy
- Remove circular dependencies
- Maintain existing functionality contracts

### Phase 2: Core Managers (Weeks 3-4)
**Priority: High**
```
5. IPMPestManager.cs → Rebuild as EnhancedIPMPestManager
6. IPMBiologicalManager.cs → Rebuild as EnhancedIPMBiologicalManager
7. IPMEnvironmentalManager.cs → Rebuild as EnhancedIPMEnvironmentalManager
8. IPMAnalyticsManager.cs → Rebuild as EnhancedIPMAnalyticsManager
```

**Goals:**
- Implement specialized pest management
- Advanced biological control systems
- Environmental factor integration
- Comprehensive analytics and reporting

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
**Priority: Medium**
```
9. IPMStrategyManager.cs → Rebuild as EnhancedIPMStrategyManager
10. IPMGamingManager.cs → Rebuild as EnhancedIPMGamingManager
11. IPMManagerImplementations.cs → Rebuild as ConcreteIPMImplementations
```

**Goals:**
- Strategic AI decision making
- Advanced gaming mechanics
- Player engagement systems
- Competitive elements

### Phase 4: Data Structures & Polish (Week 7)
**Priority: Low**
```
12. IPMPestDataStructures.cs → Integrate into IPMSharedTypes.cs
13. IPMBiologicalDataStructures.cs → Integrate into IPMSharedTypes.cs
14. IPMStrategyDataStructures.cs → Integrate into IPMSharedTypes.cs  
15. IPMAnalyticsDataStructures.cs → Integrate into IPMSharedTypes.cs
16. IPMStubs.cs → Replace with concrete implementations
```

**Goals:**
- Consolidate data structures
- Remove stub implementations
- Performance optimization
- Final integration testing

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- ProjectChimera.Core (GameManager, ChimeraManager)
- ProjectChimera.Data.IPM (IPMSharedTypes)
- ProjectChimera.Systems.Environment (for integration)
- ProjectChimera.Systems.Cultivation (plant health integration)

### Performance Targets
- Support 1000+ simultaneous pest instances
- Real-time threat assessment (60 FPS)
- Sub-100ms treatment response time
- Memory usage <50MB for IPM systems

### Integration Points
- Plant health system integration
- Environmental control system coordination
- Economic system for treatment costs
- Analytics integration for facility-wide metrics

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual manager functionality
- Data structure validation
- Algorithm correctness
- Edge case handling

### Integration Tests  
- Cross-system communication
- Event-driven interactions
- Performance under load
- Memory leak detection

### Gameplay Tests
- Player experience flows
- Balance and difficulty tuning
- Achievement system validation
- Competitive feature testing

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Complex pest AI behavior** - Start with simple state machines
2. **Performance with many pests** - Implement LOD system early
3. **Integration complexity** - Maintain clean interfaces
4. **Circular dependencies** - Strict dependency auditing

### Contingency Plans
- Keep CleanIPMManager as fallback for critical functionality
- Implement feature toggles for gradual rollout
- Maintain comprehensive unit test coverage
- Document all architectural decisions

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success

## Notes
- All disabled files contain sophisticated IPM gaming mechanics
- Scientific accuracy must be preserved during rebuild
- Player agency and meaningful choices are critical
- System should be accessible to beginners but challenging for experts
- Integration with SpeedTree plant visualization is desired
