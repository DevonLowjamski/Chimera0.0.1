## PHASE 1: EMERGENCY TRIAGE & FOUNDATION STABILIZATION
**Duration: 4 Weeks | Priority: CRITICAL**
**Goal: Stop the bleeding and create stable architectural foundation**

### Week 1: Architectural Decision Making & Code Audit

#### 1.0 Project Unification & Source Control Consolidation (CRITICAL PRE-TASK)
**OVERVIEW**: This is the absolute first priority. The codebase currently exists as two parallel Unity projects (`Projects/` and `Projects/Chimera/`). This introduces critical risks of data loss, conflicting changes, and build instability. This task will unify them into a single, canonical project structure.

**DELIVERABLES**:
- [ ] **Documented decision** on the canonical project folder.
- [ ] **Complete backup** of the entire `Projects/` directory.
- [ ] **A single, unified project folder** with no duplicates.
- [ ] **A clean, non-nested Git repository** at the project root.
- [ ] **A functional Unity project** that opens without critical errors.

**STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE**:

**Sub-Task 1: Investigation & Decision**
- **Goal**: Determine which project folder (`Projects/` or `Projects/Chimera/`) is the correct "source of truth".
- **Action Items**:
  1.  **Compare Modification Dates**: Use file system tools to check the most recently modified files in both `Assets/` directories. The project with more recent, meaningful changes is likely the active one.
  2.  **Review Git History**: Navigate into each directory that contains a `.git` folder and run `git log -1`. Compare the most recent commit messages and dates. The repository with the most recent and relevant commit history is the strongest candidate for the canonical source.
  3.  **Analyze Folder Contents**:
      -   `Projects/` contains documentation and analysis files, suggesting it's the primary workspace.
      -   `Projects/Chimera/` contains `Library/` and `Temp/` folders, indicating it has been opened as a Unity project.
- **Suggestion**: The evidence points towards `Projects/` being the main workspace and `Projects/Chimera/` being either a clone or an older version. The final decision should be based on the Git history.
- **Decision**: Document the chosen canonical project folder and the justification.

**Sub-Task 2: Backup & Source Control Isolation**
- **Goal**: Prevent any data loss and stop further divergence before making changes.
- **Action Items**:
  1.  **Full Backup**: Create a complete `.zip` archive of the *entire* `/Users/devon/Documents/Cursor/Projects` directory. Name it something clear, like `ProjectChimera_Pre-Unification-Backup_[Date].zip`. Store this in a safe location outside of the project folder.
  2.  **Isolate Git Repositories**:
      -   The presence of two `.git` folders is a major issue (nested repositories).
      -   Decide on the single `.git` folder to keep (from the canonical project identified in Sub-Task 1).
      -   In the redundant project's directory, rename the git folder to prevent accidental commits: `mv .git .git_backup`

**Sub-Task 3: Content Consolidation & Merge**
- **Goal**: Move any unique, valuable files from the redundant project into the canonical one.
- **Action Items**:
  1.  **Identify Unique Assets**: Based on the directory analysis, the unique folders in `Projects/` are `Documentation/`, `Tools/`, and `Unity Documentation/`. Confirm these do not exist in the redundant project.
  2.  **Perform the Merge**: Carefully move these unique folders from the redundant project structure into the chosen canonical project structure.
  3.  **Do NOT Merge `Library/` or `Temp/`**: These folders are generated by Unity and should never be copied between projects. They contain local cache data that can cause significant, hard-to-diagnose issues if migrated.

**Sub-Task 4: Final Cleanup & Verification**
- **Goal**: Delete the redundant project structure and ensure the unified project is clean and functional.
- **Action Items**:
  1.  **Delete Redundant Folder**: Once all unique assets have been merged and backups are confirmed, **permanently delete** the entire redundant project folder.
  2.  **Force Unity Rebuild**: In the now-unified canonical project folder, delete the `Library/` and `Temp/` folders. This is a critical step. It forces Unity to perform a clean import and rebuild all project caches, which can resolve a wide range of issues.
  3.  **Verify Project Integrity**:
      -   Open the canonical project in the Unity Editor. It will take a long time to load as it re-imports everything. This is expected.
      -   Confirm that the project loads without any critical compilation errors related to file paths or missing assets.
      -   Verify that the source control is now clean, with a single `.git` directory at the project root.

#### 1.1 System Ownership Declaration
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] **Save System Decision**: Keep `Systems/Save/SaveManager.cs`, delete `Core/SaveManager.cs`
- [ ] **Progression System Decision**: Choose single ProgressionManager from 4+ options
- [ ] **Meta-Gameplay & AI System Decision**: Choose between AIAdvisorManager (pure simulation) OR AIGamingManager (hybrid "game-within-a-game" model). This is a critical product strategy decision.
- [ ] **Achievement System Decision**: Consolidate to single AchievementManager
- [ ] **UI Manager Decision**: Keep UIManager.cs, delete GameUIManager.cs

**Technical Actions:**
```csharp
// Document architectural decisions in new file
// Assets/ProjectChimera/Documentation/ArchitecturalDecisions.md
- ADR-001: Save System Consolidation
- ADR-002: Progression System Unification  
- ADR-003: Meta-Gameplay & AI Strategy
- ADR-004: UI Manager Standardization
```

#### 1.2 Complete Code Audit & Inventory
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] **Automated Code Audit**: Develop and run scripts to automatically find all files matching patterns like `*Manager.cs`, `*.cs.disabled`, `*.backup`, and other redundancy markers. The script's output will be the definitive audit log.
- [ ] **Disabled Code Catalog**: Generated by script, reviewed by a developer.
- [ ] **Duplicate Class Inventory**: Generated by script, reviewed by a developer.
- [ ] **Assembly Dependency Map**: Document current and required assembly references
- [ ] **Monolithic Class Identification**: Flag all files >500 lines for refactoring
- [ ] **Namespace Conflict Resolution**: Document all using aliases and conflicts

**Technical Actions:**
```bash
# Example shell script for automated audit
echo "--- Finding Disabled Files ---"
find ./Assets -name "*.cs.disabled"

echo "--- Finding Backup Files ---"
find ./Assets -name "*.backup"

echo "--- Finding Redundant Managers ---"
find ./Assets -name "*Manager.cs" | xargs -L1 basename | sort | uniq -d
```

### Week 2: Ruthless Code Deletion & Cleanup

#### 2.1 Remove Redundant Managers
**Deletion List (Based on audit script results and decisions):**
- [ ] Delete `Core/SaveManager.cs` and all ISaveable interfaces
- [ ] Delete 3+ redundant progression managers (keep chosen one)
- [ ] Delete redundant achievement managers
- [ ] Delete unused AI system (advisor OR gaming)
- [ ] Delete `GameUIManager.cs` and related duplicate UI components

#### 2.2 Disabled Code Elimination
**Actions:**
- [ ] **Delete ALL .cs.disabled files** (47 files in Genetics system alone)
- [ ] **Delete ALL .backup files** throughout project
- [ ] **Delete commented-out using statements** in AI system
- [ ] **Remove obsolete namespace aliases** no longer needed

#### 2.3 Namespace Cleanup
**Technical Actions:**
```csharp
// Remove unnecessary using aliases like:
// using EnvironmentalConditions = ProjectChimera.Data.Cultivation.EnvironmentalConditions;
// Only keep aliases that resolve actual conflicts
```

### Week 3: Critical Architecture Fixes

#### 3.1 Assembly Dependency Resolution
**Required Assembly Reference Updates:**
- [ ] **AI Assembly**: Add references to Cultivation, Genetics, Economy systems
- [ ] **Economy Assembly**: Add references to Cultivation, Genetics systems  
- [ ] **Progression Assembly**: Add references to all systems for event listening
- [ ] **Testing Assemblies**: Add comprehensive system references

**Technical Implementation:**
```json
// ProjectChimera.AI.asmdef
{
    "references": [
        "ProjectChimera.Systems.Cultivation",
        "ProjectChimera.Genetics", 
        "ProjectChimera.Systems.Economy",
        "ProjectChimera.Data.Genetics",
        "ProjectChimera.Data.Cultivation"
    ]
}
```

#### 3.2 Data Synchronization Fix
**Critical Fix - Cultivation System:**
- [ ] **Establish CultivationManager as single source of truth** for plant data
- [ ] **Refactor PlantManager** to query CultivationManager instead of maintaining separate dictionary
- [ ] **Remove duplicate plant dictionaries** from PlantManager
- [ ] **Update all plant access methods** to use centralized data

**Technical Implementation:**
```csharp
// PlantManager.cs - Remove duplicate data
// DELETE: private Dictionary<string, PlantInstance> _activePlants;
// REPLACE WITH: 
private CultivationManager _cultivationManager;
public PlantInstance GetPlant(string id) => _cultivationManager.GetPlant(id);
```

#### 3.3 Event System Enforcement
**Communication Rules:**
- [ ] **Enforce event-driven communication** for all cross-system interactions
- [ ] **Remove direct manager references** between systems
- [ ] **Standardize GameEventSO usage** across all systems
- [ ] **Document event channel mappings** in architecture guide

#### 3.4 Architectural Enforcement: Automated Linting
**Goal**: Prevent future architectural decay automatically.
- [ ] **Implement CI/CD Linter**: Integrate a static analysis tool (linter) into the source control pipeline (e.g., as a GitHub Action).
- [ ] **Configure File Size Rule**: Set a hard limit (e.g., 400 lines) for C# files. The linter will automatically fail any Pull Request that introduces a file exceeding this limit.
- [ ] **Add Other Best Practices**: Configure rules to check for common issues like incorrect namespace usage, public fields, etc.

## PHASE 2: CORE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
**Duration: 12 Weeks | Priority: HIGH**
**Goal: Transform placeholder systems into fully functional engines**

### Phase 2 Kickoff Strategy: The Vertical Slice (Week 5)
**Objective**: Before implementing the full breadth of each system, the first week of Phase 2 will be dedicated to creating a single, thin, end-to-end gameplay loop. This is the top priority for this phase.
- **1. Plant**: A single seed can be planted (`CultivationManager`).
- **2. Harvest**: The mature plant can be harvested, creating a product in a new, simple `PlayerInventory` system.
- **3. Sell**: The product can be sold via `MarketManager`, debiting the inventory.
- **4. Progress**: The sale triggers an event heard by `ProgressionManager` to grant a small amount of XP.

**Rationale**: This forces immediate, simple integration between Cultivation, Economy, and Progression. It will surface critical connection issues, validate the refactored architecture from Phase 1, and provide a tangible, testable result far earlier in the development cycle.
