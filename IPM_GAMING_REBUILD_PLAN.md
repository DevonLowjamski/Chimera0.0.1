|------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| `Assets/ProjectChimera/Systems/IPM/` | Multiple files exist | Likely Gaming namespace conflicts | HIGH |
| `Assets/ProjectChimera/Data/IPM/` | Data structures present | May conflict with Systems | HIGH |
| IPM Gaming integration | Cross-system dependencies | Circular references probable | HIGH |

### **Gaming System Architecture Issues**
Based on the genetics system problems, similar issues likely exist:

| System Area | Probable Issues | Impact |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|

## 🎮 GAMING SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE REVIEW

### **Current Gaming System Issues (Predicted)**
Based on genetics system experience:

| Component | Likely Problems | Solution Strategy |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Gaming Data Structures | Scattered across multiple namespaces | Centralize in `ProjectChimera.Data.Gaming` |
| Gaming Managers | Circular dependencies | Create clean manager hierarchy |
| Cross-System Gaming | Type conflicts between systems | Establish gaming interfaces |

## 📋 COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM AUDIT PLAN

### **Step 1: Complete File Inventory**
Execute comprehensive analysis of:

1. **IPM System Files**
   ```bash
   # Inventory all IPM files
   find Assets/ProjectChimera -path "*IPM*" -name "*.cs"
   
   # Check for Gaming namespace references
   grep -r "Gaming" Assets/ProjectChimera/Systems/IPM/
   grep -r "Gaming" Assets/ProjectChimera/Data/IPM/
   ```

2. **Gaming System Files**
   ```bash
   # Inventory all Gaming files  
   find Assets/ProjectChimera -path "*Gaming*" -name "*.cs"
   
   # Check for circular dependencies
   grep -r "IPM\|Genetics\|Environment" Assets/ProjectChimera/Systems/Gaming/
   ```

3. **Cross-System References**
   ```bash
   # Find files referencing multiple systems
   grep -r "Systems\.Gaming" Assets/ProjectChimera/Systems/
   grep -r "Systems\.IPM" Assets/ProjectChimera/Systems/
   ```

### **Step 2: Conflict Pattern Analysis**
1. **Duplicate Type Detection**
   - Search for duplicate class definitions
