Unity Refresh Instructions:

The compilation errors should now be fixed. If Unity is still showing CS0246 errors, try these steps in order:

1. **Close Unity completely**
2. **Delete these folders from the project root:**
   - Library/
   - Temp/
   - obj/
   - Any .csproj or .sln files

3. **Reopen Unity** - this forces complete project regeneration

4. **In Unity, go to:**
   - Assets → Refresh (Ctrl+R / Cmd+R)
   - Assets → Reimport All

5. **If errors persist:**
   - Edit → Project Settings → Script Compilation → Clear Cache
   - Window → General → Console → Clear Console
   - Check if the errors still show

**What was fixed:**
- Created missing GeneDefinitionSO.cs with all required properties
- Fixed assembly references (ProjectChimera.Systems.Environment → ProjectChimera.Environment)
- Added Unity.ugui package references to all assemblies
- Fixed type qualifications (OfType<CannabisGeneticsEngine.Allele>())
- Fixed property references (gene.GeneId → gene.GeneCode)

The fixes are complete and should resolve the CS0246 errors once Unity refreshes properly.
