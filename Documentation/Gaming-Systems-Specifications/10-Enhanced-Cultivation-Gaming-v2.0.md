### **2. Earned Automation Progression System**

#### **Manual-to-Automation Gaming Mechanics**
```csharp
public class EarnedAutomationProgression
{
    // Burden of Consistency Gaming
    public AutomationDesire CalculateAutomationDesire(ManualCareTask task, PlayerProficiency proficiency)
    {
        return new AutomationDesire
        {
            CognitiveLoad = CalculateMentalEffort(task.Complexity, task.Frequency),
            TimeInvestment = CalculateTimeRequirement(task.Duration, task.PlantCount),
            ConsistencyChallenge = CalculateConsistencyDifficulty(task.PrecisionRequired, proficiency.CurrentSkill),
            ScalePressure = CalculateScalingPressure(task.PlantCount, task.FacilitySize),
            QualityRisk = CalculateQualityImpact(task.ErrorTolerance, proficiency.ConsistencyRating)
        };
    }
    
    // Automation Unlock Rewards
    public AutomationUnlock UnlockAutomationSystem(CultivationTask task, PlayerProgress progress)
    {
        return new AutomationUnlock
