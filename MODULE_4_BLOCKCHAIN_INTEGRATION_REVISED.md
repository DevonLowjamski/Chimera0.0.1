### ü§î **IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES TO SOLVE**

#### **Primary Challenge: Avoiding Cryptocurrency Infrastructure**
- **Problem**: Most established blockchains require cryptocurrency for transactions
- **Impact**: Would force users to buy crypto tokens to use genetics features
- **Desired Solution**: Genetic data recording without user financial burden

#### **Secondary Challenge: Infrastructure Costs**
- **Problem**: Running private blockchain requires significant server infrastructure
- **Impact**: Ongoing operational costs for the project
- **Desired Solution**: Leverage existing blockchain without operational overhead

#### **Potential Alternative Approaches (To Research)**

1. **Permissioned Blockchain Networks**
   - Use enterprise blockchain solutions (Hyperledger, R3 Corda)
   - No cryptocurrency required
   - Challenge: Still requires infrastructure investment

2. **Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)**
   - Use cloud provider blockchain services (Azure Blockchain, AWS Blockchain)
   - Pay traditional cloud costs instead of crypto
   - Challenge: Ongoing subscription costs

3. **Hybrid Ledger Approach**
   - Local encrypted database with periodic blockchain checkpoints
   - Reduced blockchain interaction frequency
   - Challenge: Less real-time verification

4. **Consortium Blockchain**
   - Partner with cannabis genetics organizations
   - Shared infrastructure costs
   - Challenge: Requires industry partnerships
