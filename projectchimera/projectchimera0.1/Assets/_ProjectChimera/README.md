# Project Chimera - Data Architecture Foundation

## Quick Setup Guide

### 1. **Verify Compilation**
- Open Unity and let it compile all scripts
- Check the Console for any remaining errors
- All scripts should now compile without namespace issues

### 2. **Create Your First Scene**
1. Create a new scene: `File > New Scene`
2. Create an empty GameObject: `GameObject > Create Empty`
3. Rename it to "GameManager"
4. Add the GameManager script: `Add Component > GameManager`

### 3. **Test the Data System**
1. Go to `Window > Project Chimera > Data Creation Wizard`
2. Click "Create All Sample Data" to generate example assets
3. Play the scene and check the Console for data loading messages

### 4. **What You've Built**

**Core Systems:**
- ✅ **GameManager**: Central game controller with singleton pattern
- ✅ **DataManager**: Loads and manages all game data
- ✅ **Genetic System**: Trait definitions with inheritance patterns
- ✅ **Plant Simulation**: Individual plant instances with growth
- ✅ **Equipment System**: Cultivation equipment with effects
- ✅ **Nutrient System**: Plant nutrients and supplements

**Data Architecture:**
- ✅ **ScriptableObject-based**: All game content is data-driven
- ✅ **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and modify
- ✅ **Editor Tools**: Wizard for creating sample data

### 5. **Folder Structure**
```
Assets/_ProjectChimera/
├── Scripts/
│   ├── Core/ (GameManager, DataManager)
│   ├── Data/ (ScriptableObject definitions)
│   ├── Cultivation/ (PlantInstance)
│   └── Editor/ (DataCreationWizard)
├── Data/ (Asset storage)
└── Resources/Data/ (Runtime-loadable assets)
```

### 6. **Next Development Steps**
Once the foundation is working:
- Environment simulation systems
- Equipment placement and effects
- Economic mechanics
- UI systems
- Save/load functionality

### 7. **Key Features**

**Genetic System:**
- Traits define plant characteristics (THC, CBD, yield, etc.)
- Inheritance patterns (additive, dominant, recessive)
- Environmental interaction curves

**Plant Simulation:**
- Real-time growth based on genetics and environment
- Health and stress calculations
- Growth stage progression

**Data-Driven Design:**
- All content defined in ScriptableObjects
- Designer-friendly workflow
- Easy to modify without code changes

This foundation provides everything needed to start building the cultivation mechanics outlined in your Project Chimera design document.
