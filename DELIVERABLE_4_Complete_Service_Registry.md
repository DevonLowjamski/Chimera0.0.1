### Service Registry API

#### Core Registration Methods
```csharp
// Register service with domain classification
void RegisterService<T>(T service, ServiceDomain domain = ServiceDomain.Core) where T : class, IService

// Get service by type
T GetService<T>() where T : class, IService

// Get service by name
IService GetService(string serviceName)

// Get services by domain
List<IService> GetServicesByDomain(ServiceDomain domain)

// Check registration status
bool IsServiceRegistered<T>() where T : class, IService
```

#### Lifecycle Management Methods
```csharp
// Initialize all registered services
void InitializeAllServices()

// Shutdown all services
void ShutdownAllServices()

// Get services by status
List<IService> GetServicesByStatus(bool initialized)
```

#### Analytics and Reporting
```csharp
// Generate comprehensive report
ServiceRegistryReport GenerateReport()

// Log detailed status
void LogRegistryStatus()
```

### Integration with Existing Systems

#### GameManager Integration
The ServiceRegistry integrates seamlessly with the existing GameManager pattern:

```csharp
// Registration during system initialization
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void Start()
    {
        var cultivationService = new PlantLifecycleService();
        ServiceRegistry.Instance.RegisterService<IPlantLifecycleManager>(cultivationService, ServiceDomain.Cultivation);
        
        var geneticsService = new InheritanceCalculationService();
        ServiceRegistry.Instance.RegisterService<IInheritanceCalculationService>(geneticsService, ServiceDomain.Genetics);
        
        ServiceRegistry.Instance.InitializeAllServices();
    }
}
```

#### Service Dependencies
Services can access other services through the registry:

```csharp
public class PlantGrowthService : IPlantGrowthService
{
    private IInheritanceCalculationService _geneticsService;
    private IEnvironmentalManager _environmentService;
    
    public void Initialize()
    {
        _geneticsService = ServiceRegistry.Instance.GetService<IInheritanceCalculationService>();
        _environmentService = ServiceRegistry.Instance.GetService<IEnvironmentalManager>();
        IsInitialized = true;
    }
}
```

### Usage Patterns

#### 1. Service Registration Pattern
```csharp
// During system startup
var competitionService = new CompetitionManagementService();
ServiceRegistry.Instance.RegisterService<ICompetitionManagementService>(
    competitionService, 
    ServiceDomain.Competition
);
```

#### 2. Service Discovery Pattern
```csharp
// In dependent systems
var researchService = ServiceRegistry.Instance.GetService<IResearchProjectService>();
if (researchService != null && researchService.IsInitialized)
{
    var project = researchService.CreateProject("Advanced Genetics", ResearchCategory.Genetics, requirements);
}
```

#### 3. Domain-based Service Access
```csharp
// Get all cultivation services
var cultivationServices = ServiceRegistry.Instance.GetServicesByDomain(ServiceDomain.Cultivation);
foreach (var service in cultivationServices)
{
    if (!service.IsInitialized)
    {
        service.Initialize();
    }
}
```

### Testing Integration

#### Service Registry Testing
The registry integrates with the existing PC013 testing framework:

```csharp
[Test]
public void ServiceRegistry_RegisterAndRetrieve_WorksCorrectly()
{
    var testService = new TestCultivationService();
    ServiceRegistry.Instance.RegisterService<ITestService>(testService, ServiceDomain.Testing);
    
    var retrievedService = ServiceRegistry.Instance.GetService<ITestService>();
    Assert.IsNotNull(retrievedService);
    Assert.AreEqual(testService, retrievedService);
}
```

#### Service Integration Testing
```csharp
[Test]
public void ServiceOrchestration_CrossServiceCommunication_ExecutesCorrectly()
{
    // Register test services
    ServiceRegistry.Instance.RegisterService<ICompetitionManagementService>(mockCompetitionService);
    ServiceRegistry.Instance.RegisterService<IJudgingEvaluationService>(mockJudgingService);
    
    // Initialize all services
    ServiceRegistry.Instance.InitializeAllServices();
    
    // Test cross-service communication
    var competitionService = ServiceRegistry.Instance.GetService<ICompetitionManagementService>();
    var tournamentId = competitionService.CreateTournament("Test Tournament", CompetitionType.Indoor, DateTime.Now, DateTime.Now.AddDays(7));
    
    var judgingService = ServiceRegistry.Instance.GetService<IJudgingEvaluationService>();
    var success = judgingService.AssignJudge("judge1", tournamentId);
    
    Assert.IsTrue(success);
}
```

### Performance Considerations

#### Registry Optimization
- **Service Caching**: All registered services cached in memory
- **Type-based Lookup**: O(1) service retrieval by type
- **Domain Indexing**: Fast domain-based service filtering
- **Lazy Initialization**: Services initialized only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup during shutdown

#### Scalability Features
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent service access support
- **Event System**: Non-blocking event notification
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on service failures
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive service health tracking

### Future Enhancements

#### Phase 2 Extensions
1. **Dynamic Service Loading**: Runtime service plugin support
2. **Service Versioning**: Multiple service version management
3. **Dependency Injection**: Advanced IoC container integration
4. **Service Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics
5. **Service Mesh**: Distributed service communication

#### Advanced Features
1. **Service Contracts**: Formal interface contracts
2. **Service Discovery Protocol**: Network-based service discovery
3. **Service Health Checks**: Automated health monitoring
4. **Service Load Balancing**: Multiple service instance support
5. **Service Configuration**: Dynamic service configuration

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Service Creation Best Practices
1. **Interface First**: Always define interface before implementation
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one core concern
3. **Event-Driven**: Use events for loose coupling
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
5. **Documentation**: Complete XML documentation

#### Registry Integration Steps
1. **Define Interface**: Create service interface in ServiceInterfaces.cs
2. **Implement Service**: Create concrete service implementation
3. **Register Service**: Register with appropriate domain
4. **Initialize Service**: Call Initialize() method
5. **Test Integration**: Create comprehensive tests

### Conclusion
