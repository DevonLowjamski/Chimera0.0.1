## Assembly Structure

The project uses a modular assembly definition structure:
- `ProjectChimera.Core`: Foundation systems and utilities
- `ProjectChimera.Data`: ScriptableObject definitions
- `ProjectChimera.Genetics`: Genetics and breeding systems
- `ProjectChimera.Cultivation`: Plant lifecycle and growth
- `ProjectChimera.Environment`: Environmental simulation
- `ProjectChimera.Construction`: Building and facilities
- `ProjectChimera.Economy`: Economic systems
- `ProjectChimera.Progression`: Skills and research
- `ProjectChimera.UI`: User interface
- `ProjectChimera.Testing`: Testing utilities

## Development Philosophy

- **ScriptableObject-driven**: Extensive use of SO for data configuration
- **Event-driven architecture**: Decoupled systems using SO-based events
- **Modular design**: Clear separation of concerns with well-defined APIs
- **SOLID principles**: Maintainable, testable code architecture
- **Comprehensive testing**: Automated validation and performance monitoring

## Getting Started

1. Open the project in Unity 6000.2.0b2 (Unity 6 Beta)
2. Ensure Universal Render Pipeline (URP) is configured
3. Run initial data validation tests
4. Review architecture documentation in Documentation/

## Key Features

- **Deep Genetics Simulation**: Sophisticated inheritance and breeding mechanics
