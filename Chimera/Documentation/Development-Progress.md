# Project Chimera - Development Progress

## Completed: Phase 0.1 - Project Structure & Organization ✅

### Directory Structure Created
- Complete Unity project structure with organized folder hierarchy
- Modular assembly definition architecture
- Documentation and testing framework foundation
- Tools and build automation structure

### Key Achievements
1. **Root Structure**: Assets/ProjectChimera with Core, Data, Systems, UI, Visuals, Testing
2. **Assembly Definitions**: 9 modular assemblies for clean separation of concerns
3. **Package Management**: Unity package manifest with URP and essential packages
4. **Documentation**: Architecture overview and project README

## Completed: Phase 0.2 - Core Architecture Foundation ✅

### Base Class Hierarchy Created
A complete foundation of base classes following Project Chimera's architectural principles:

#### Core Base Classes
1. **ChimeraScriptableObject**: Foundation for all SO with validation and ID system
2. **ChimeraMonoBehaviour**: Base MonoBehaviour with logging and lifecycle management
3. **ChimeraManager**: Singleton-like managers for major game systems
4. **ChimeraSystem**: Startable/stoppable systems with priority and update intervals

#### Specialized Base Classes
5. **ChimeraDataSO**: Read-only game data with category organization
6. **ChimeraConfigSO**: Runtime-modifiable configuration with persistence
7. **ChimeraEventSO**: Event channel base with listener management
8. **SimulationEntity**: Time-scaled simulation participants
9. **CultivationEntity**: Cannabis cultivation-specific entities (plants, equipment)
10. **EnvironmentalEntity**: Environmental systems (HVAC, sensors, lighting)

### Event System Implementation
Complete event-driven architecture foundation:

#### Event Channel System
- **GameEventSO<T>**: Generic typed event channels
- **GameEventListener<T>**: Component-based event listeners with UnityEvent integration
- **Concrete Implementations**: Simple, String, Float, Int event types
- **Safety Features**: Listener count limits, null reference protection, cleanup

#### Key Features
- Type-safe event communication
- Inspector-friendly configuration
- Memory leak protection
- Automatic cleanup on domain reload
- Bridge between code and Unity's visual scripting

### Architectural Principles Implemented
1. **ScriptableObject-Driven Design**: All data extends ChimeraDataSO
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Decoupled communication via SO-based events
3. **Modular Assembly Structure**: Clean dependency management
4. **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, dependency injection ready
5. **Project Chimera Naming Conventions**: _privateField, PublicProperty, FunctionName()

## Completed: Core Manager System Implementation ✅

### Complete Manager Architecture
All core managers have been implemented following Project Chimera's architectural patterns:

#### Core Managers Implemented
1. **GameManager**: Central game state coordination with singleton pattern, manager registry, and coordinated initialization
2. **TimeManager**: Game time acceleration, offline progression, and time-scaling simulation system
3. **DataManager**: ScriptableObject asset management with validation, caching, and type-safe retrieval
4. **EventManager**: Global event system coordination with metrics, debugging, and performance monitoring
5. **SaveManager**: Save/load system with DTOs, auto-save, multiple slots, and data serialization
6. **SettingsManager**: Player preferences with real-time application, validation, and category organization

### Key Features Implemented
- **Manager Registry System**: Dynamic manager access and coordinated lifecycle management
- **Game State Management**: Centralized state transitions with listener pattern
- **Time Scaling Architecture**: Real-time to accelerated game time conversion for simulation
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Decoupled system communication via SO-based events
- **Data Asset Pipeline**: Centralized SO management with validation and performance optimization
- **Comprehensive Save System**: Multi-slot saves with DTOs, compression, and error handling
- **Settings Framework**: Category-based settings with real-time application and validation

## Current Status: Ready for Phase 0.3 - Data Architecture

The core manager foundation is complete and robust. All subsequent systems will build upon these managers, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

### Next Steps (Phase 0.3)
- [ ] Data Architecture & ScriptableObject Framework
  - [ ] Cannabis genetics data structures
  - [ ] Environmental parameter data
  - [ ] Equipment and facility data
  - [ ] Market and economic data
  - [ ] Research and breeding data

### Code Quality Metrics Achieved
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions following Project Chimera standards
- ✅ Comprehensive XML documentation for all public APIs
- ✅ Robust error handling and logging systems
- ✅ Memory-safe event system with cleanup protocols
- ✅ Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Time-scaling simulation foundation for complex gameplay
