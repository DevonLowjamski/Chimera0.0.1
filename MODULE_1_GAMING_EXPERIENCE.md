## 🎯 **DETAILED DELIVERABLES**

### **📦 DELIVERABLE 1: GameEventBus System (Week 1)**
**Core Infrastructure for Real-Time Gaming Events**

#### **1.1 Event Bus Architecture**
```csharp
// Core event bus interface
public interface IGameEventBus
{
    void Subscribe<T>(IGameEventHandler<T> handler) where T : GameEvent;
    void Publish<T>(T gameEvent) where T : GameEvent;
    void PublishAsync<T>(T gameEvent) where T : GameEvent;
    void UnsubscribeAll(object subscriber);
    
    // Gaming-specific optimizations
    void PublishImmediate<T>(T gameEvent) where T : GameEvent; // <16ms guarantee
    void PublishWithPriority<T>(T gameEvent, EventPriority priority) where T : GameEvent;
}

// High-performance implementation
public class GameEventBus : IGameEventBus
{
    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<Type, List<object>> _handlers = new();
    private readonly ObjectPool<EventProcessingTask> _taskPool;
    private readonly PriorityQueue<GameEvent> _immediateEvents;
    
    // Gaming performance targets:
    // - <16ms for immediate events (UI responsiveness)
    // - <100ms for standard events (achievement notifications)
    // - Background processing for analytics events
}
```
