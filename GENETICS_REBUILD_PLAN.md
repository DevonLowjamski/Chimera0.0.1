## üìã TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### **Clean Architecture Principles**
1. **Single Namespace Responsibility**
   - Gaming types in `ProjectChimera.Data.Gaming`
   - Genetics types in `ProjectChimera.Data.Genetics`
   - No circular dependencies

2. **Dependency Direction**
   - Data ‚Üê Systems ‚Üê UI
   - Core ‚Üê Specialized systems
   - Never: Specialized ‚Üí Core

3. **Type Definitions**
   - One canonical definition per type
   - Shared types in Data namespace
   - System-specific types in Systems namespace

### **Rebuilding Guidelines**
1. **Start with Data Structures**
   - Define clean types first
   - Establish clear interfaces
   - Document dependencies

2. **Build Incrementally**
   - One system at a time
   - Test compilation at each step
   - Verify functionality before proceeding

3. **Preserve Science & Fun**
   - Maintain scientific accuracy
   - Keep entertaining gameplay
   - Balance education with engagement
