# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create API for AI Agent Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the API endpoint that allows AI agents to query the MCP for contextual information.
# Details:
Implement a RESTful API endpoint that accepts query requests from AI agents. The API should receive a query string, process it through the query processing system, and return a structured response containing relevant text snippets with source document references. Include appropriate error handling, request validation, and response formatting. Document the API for integration by AI agent developers.

# Test Strategy:
Test API functionality with various valid and invalid requests. Verify correct response formats and error handling. Perform basic load testing to ensure the API can handle expected query volumes.
