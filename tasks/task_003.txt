# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Document Parser and Text Extractor
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Document Parser/Text Extractor component that processes raw file content into clean, normalized text suitable for NLP processing.
# Details:
Implement text cleaning and normalization functions to process the raw content from files. This should include removing irrelevant artifacts, handling special characters, normalizing whitespace, and potentially segmenting text into paragraphs or sections. Create a Document data model as specified in the PRD to store both raw and processed text along with metadata. Focus on .txt and .md files for the MVP, with extensibility in mind for future file types.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various text formats and styles to ensure proper cleaning and normalization. Verify the Document model correctly stores all required information. Use sample documents with known artifacts to verify cleaning effectiveness.
