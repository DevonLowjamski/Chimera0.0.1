# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Query Processing System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the system that processes incoming queries from AI agents, converts them to embeddings, and retrieves relevant context.
# Details:
Create a query processing pipeline that takes a natural language query from an AI agent, preprocesses it similarly to document text, generates an embedding for the query, searches the vector index for similar content, and returns ranked results. Implement result formatting to include both the relevant text snippets and references to their source documents. Design the system to handle various query types and lengths effectively.

# Test Strategy:
Test with a variety of query types (questions, code snippets, keywords). Verify the system returns relevant results for each query type. Test edge cases like very short queries, very specific queries, and queries with no relevant matches in the index.
