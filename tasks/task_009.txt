# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement End-to-End System Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect all components into a cohesive system and implement the main application flow from configuration to query response.
# Details:
Integrate all previously developed components into a complete system. Implement the main application flow: reading configuration, scanning the specified folder, processing documents, building the index, and serving queries through the API. Ensure proper error handling and logging throughout the system. Create a simple startup/initialization process that prepares the system for use.

# Test Strategy:
Perform end-to-end testing with real documents and queries. Verify the entire pipeline works correctly from configuration to query response. Test system behavior with various folder configurations and document sets.
