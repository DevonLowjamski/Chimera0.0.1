# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Embedding Generation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core NLP component that generates vector embeddings for text chunks to enable semantic search capabilities.
# Details:
Select and integrate an appropriate embedding model (e.g., Sentence-Transformers for Python or equivalent). Implement functionality to generate vector embeddings for each text chunk. Optimize the embedding process for performance, potentially using batching or parallel processing for larger document sets. Store embeddings alongside their corresponding text chunks in the IndexEntry data model as specified in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Verify embeddings are generated correctly by testing with known similar and dissimilar text chunks. Measure embedding generation performance and optimize if necessary. Test with edge cases like very short or unusual text.
