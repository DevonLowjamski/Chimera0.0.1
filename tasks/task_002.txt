# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement File System Scanner
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the File System Monitor/Scanner component that detects and reads files from the specified folder, focusing on .txt and .md files.
# Details:
Create a module that can scan a directory (and optionally its subdirectories) to identify .txt and .md files. Implement functions to read these files and extract their raw content. Store basic metadata about each file (path, size, last modified date, etc.). Design the scanner to be extensible for future file types (e.g., PDF). Consider implementing a simple caching mechanism to avoid re-processing unchanged files.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various folder structures containing different file types. Verify all .txt and .md files are correctly identified and their content is properly extracted. Test edge cases like empty files, large files, and files with unusual characters.
