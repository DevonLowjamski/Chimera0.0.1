# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create Basic Status Information Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement a simple interface to provide feedback on system status, including whether the folder was processed successfully and basic information about the indexed document set.
# Details:
Develop a simple status reporting mechanism that provides information about the system's state. Include details such as the number of documents processed, file types found, index size, and any processing errors encountered. This could be implemented as an additional API endpoint, a log file, or a simple command-line interface depending on the deployment context. Focus on providing clear feedback about whether the specified folder was processed successfully.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the status interface correctly reports system state in various scenarios (successful processing, errors, empty folders, etc.). Test that all relevant metrics are accurately reported.
