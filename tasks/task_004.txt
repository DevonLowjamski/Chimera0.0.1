# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Text Chunking and Segmentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop functionality to break down processed documents into manageable chunks for more effective semantic analysis and retrieval.
# Details:
Create algorithms to segment document text into logical chunks (e.g., paragraphs, sections, or fixed-size chunks with overlap). Ensure chunks maintain context and are sized appropriately for the embedding models that will be used later. Implement strategies for handling edge cases like very short documents or extremely long sections. Store the relationship between chunks and their source documents to maintain traceability.

# Test Strategy:
Test chunking with various document types and structures. Verify chunks are sized appropriately and maintain logical coherence. Check that the relationship between chunks and source documents is preserved.
