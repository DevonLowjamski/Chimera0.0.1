# Task ID: 6
# Title: Build In-Memory Vector Index
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a simple in-memory vector index to store and efficiently query document embeddings.
# Details:
Create an in-memory data structure to store and index the vector embeddings. Implement vector similarity search functionality (e.g., cosine similarity) to find relevant text chunks based on a query embedding. Include ranking mechanisms to sort results by relevance. Design the index to be efficient for the MVP while keeping in mind future scalability needs. Consider using existing libraries for vector search if appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Test search performance with various index sizes. Verify search results match expected relevance patterns. Benchmark memory usage and query response times to ensure they meet requirements.
