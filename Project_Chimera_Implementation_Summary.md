## Current State Assessment

### Project Status
- **Overall Rating**: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5) - Brilliant foundation, non-functional core
- **Architectural Excellence**: ★★★★★ (5/5) - World-class modular design
- **Implementation Gap**: Critical non-functional core systems

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **DUPLICATE PROJECT STRUCTURE**: The entire project exists in two parallel folders (`Projects/` and `Projects/Chimera/`), creating a critical risk of data loss, code conflicts, and build instability. **This is the highest priority issue.**
2. **Non-functional Core Systems**: Genetics, AI, Economy are elaborate placeholders
3. **Massive Code Redundancy**: 4+ progression managers, duplicate save systems
4. **Strategic Ambiguity**: Unclear strategic direction between a pure simulation and a "game-within-a-game" model, evidenced by parallel "Gaming" systems.
5. **Architectural Isolation**: Missing assembly dependencies preventing integration
6. **Data Synchronization Risks**: Multiple sources of truth for plant data
7. **Monolithic Classes**: Files exceeding 640-1400 lines
8. **Disabled Code Burden**: 47+ .cs.disabled files creating maintenance nightmare

## Strategic Recovery Plan

### Phase 1: Emergency Triage (Weeks 1-4)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must complete before any other work

#### Week 1: Foundational Unification & Decision Making
- [ ] **Task 0: Unify Duplicate Projects (Highest Priority)**
  - **Goal**: Consolidate the two parallel project folders into a single, canonical Unity project.
  - **Action**: Investigate which project is the source of truth, merge unique assets, and delete the redundant folder.
  - **Success Criteria**: A single, functional Unity project with a clean Git repository.

- [ ] **Task 1: System Ownership & Direction**
  - Choose single implementation for each system (Save, Progression, etc.).
  - Make the critical "Meta-Gameplay & AI System" decision.
  - **Success Criteria**: All architectural ambiguities resolved and documented.

#### Week 2: Code Cleanup
- Delete ALL redundant managers and duplicate code based on the automated audit.
- Remove ALL .cs.disabled and .backup files
- Clean up namespace conflicts

#### Week 3: Architecture Fixes
- Fix all assembly dependencies
- Establish single source of truth for data
- Enforce event-driven communication
- **Implement automated linters in CI/CD pipeline** to prevent future monolithic files.

#### Week 4: Foundation Validation
- Ensure zero compilation errors
- Test all system integrations
- Validate event system

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Weeks 5-16)
**Priority**: HIGH - Transform placeholders into functional systems

**Kickoff Strategy: The Vertical Slice**
- The first week of Phase 2 will be dedicated to implementing a thin, end-to-end "vertical slice" of gameplay (Plant -> Harvest -> Sell -> Gain XP). This forces early integration of core systems and validates the architectural foundation before full-scale feature development.

#### Genetics System (Weeks 5-8)
- **BreedingSimulator.cs**: Implement real Mendelian inheritance
- **TraitExpressionEngine.cs**: Add QTL, epistasis, environmental interactions
- **GPU Acceleration**: Compute shader integration
- **Genetic Caching**: Performance optimization system

#### Economy System (Weeks 9-12)
- **Market Integration**: Connect to actual player production
- **Dynamic Supply/Demand**: Real-time price calculations
- **Contract System**: Production-based contract generation
- **Player Inventory**: Complete inventory management

#### AI & Progression (Weeks 13-16)
- **AI System**: Choose and implement single AI strategy
- **Progression Integration**: Connect to actual game events
- **Research System**: Functional research unlocks
- **Achievement System**: Real achievement tracking

### Phase 3: Optimization (Weeks 17-24)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Production readiness

#### Code Refactoring (Weeks 17-20)
- Break monolithic classes into manageable components
- Implement dependency injection
- Performance optimization
- Naming convention standardization

#### Performance & Testing (Weeks 21-22)
- Large-scale simulation testing (1000+ plants)
- ECS implementation if needed
- Comprehensive performance profiling

#### Advanced Features (Weeks 23-24)
- Complete IPM system implementation
- Tournament and competition systems
- Final feature integration
